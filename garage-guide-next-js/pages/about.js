                   <p> I help creative entrepreneurs and lean business owners gain an edge over their competition   and enhance their presence on the web. I assist everyday people in bringing their ideas to      life.

                    My focus is on front-end development and my years of experience as a professional artist have honed my eye and feel for good design. I believe that my knowledge of color theory and composition gives me an edge over other developers.

                    Whether you hire me to join a team or to lead a project, my aim is to bring unique solutions and ideas to the table. I keep up with the latest trends in design and tech, so that you can focus on what you do best.
                   </p>
